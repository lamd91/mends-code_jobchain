# mends_jobchain

This repository contains an implementation of MEnDS, a "Multi-resolution approach to condition categorical multiple-point realizations to dynamic data with iterative ensemble smoothing" (https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR025875).

This implementation corresponds to the execution of multiple jobs (a job chain) and is meant to be run on a CPU cluster managed by SLURM.

To run this job chain implementation, execute the bash script named "mends.sh".
